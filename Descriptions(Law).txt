Prerequisite Requirement: Completion of an honours degree, or equivalent within the field of financial accounting. 
Aim: Research Methodology is a research training module that will both prepare the student to conduct their masters’

be interlocking  and complementary  to the student’s  mathematics  and statistics  modules  (undergraduate  studies).  It aims 
to expose students to the epistemological underpinnings of research, develop your knowledge of a variety of methods 
of data collection and data analysis, give you practical experience of research and research writing, and enable you to 
design and unde rtake your own independent projects in the future. This module quips students with a broad 
understanding of both qualitative and quantitative research methods, techniques and issues and their application to 
business and management problems. The module aims  to develop a critical understanding of the value of the research 
endeavour and thereby help the management/business researcher to build business knowledge and theory that 
generates new questions as well as provides  answers.  
Content: The module focuses on designing a research project, structuring an inquiry, and the ethics and politics of 
business research. The course covers literature review skills, the tools of theory building, interviewing skills, designed a 
questionnaire, indexes/typologies and asking q uestions. The nature of quantitative research is also covered. Topics in 
the module include: identifying research problems within management and formulating specific research questions; 
research processes, problem statement and proposals; ethics in busines s research; issues in the design and 
measurement of qualitative and quantitative research; sources of qualitative and quantitative data; surveys, interviews 
and observation; and presentation of results.
