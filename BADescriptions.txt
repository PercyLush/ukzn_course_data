and knowledge  that will potentially  transform  the way we think  and act on agrarian  issues.  
Content: The course is driven by a few questions: What are the theoretical underpinnings of key rural development 
strategies  and policies?  What  is the nature  of the rural economy  in south  Africa? How do we restructure  rural agriculture 
to generate sustainable livelihoods? What is the state of non -farm economic activity in the rural areas? What is the  role 
of technology and genetic engineering? How is land reform related to rural development? W hat conditions lead to viable  
economic  activities  in rural areas?  We will cover  relevant  theoretical  paradigms  and concepts  (food  security,  food 
sovereignty,  class  dynamics,  agrarian  history,  sustainability,  off-farm employment,  rural tourism,  etc).

contexts?  
Content:  This course consists of a critical study of three sets of issues: the first explores the meani ng of 'development' 
and examines the major theoretical schools and paradigms of 'development'. The second sets out some of the political 
complexities and tensions which surrounds development, especially in respect of development strategy and 
implementation . The third part presents a view of development thinking, strategy and practice in three different regions 
of the world - Latin America in the immediate post -war era, as well as in the 1980s and 1990s; Asia in the era of the east 
Asian miracle and more rec ent case studies of China and India; finally African development challenges both in the 
immediate post -colonial era, and in the contemporary period.

state through historical and comparative analysis. After interrogating the notion of “state failure”, we explore the history  
of state -society relations in Africa. Are contemporary state formations in Africa legacies of the colonial period or do their 
origins rest with Africa’s pre -colonial polities? Comparisons  will be made with former colonies in South Asia and Latin 
America. The central focus will be to situate the South African experience.

Name: Understanding Language  
Code:  LING101  H1 (30L-10T-0P-0S-100H -16R-0F-0G-4A-13W-16C)  
Description: To introduce students to the scientific study of language  
Content:  We provide  students  with insights  into the intricate  facets  of language  by introducing  them  to various  areas  of 
linguistic  research.  We discuss  the acquisition  of language,  its repres entation  in the brain/mind,  its use in different  social 
contexts and the interaction between linguistic findings and selected fields of application. The course also includes a 
section  on research  methods  to develop  students'  academic  skills  of writing  and analysis.  
Assessment: Assessment: 1 test (20%); 2 assignments (30%); 1 three -hour examination (50%).

Prerequisite:   Recommended: Linguistics 1A  
Description: To introduce students to the key concepts and analytical skills employed in the study of language.  
Content: Various sub -disciplines of linguistics are studied in relation to one of the most important assumptions of modern  
linguistic  theory:  the concept  of language  as a “mental  organ”,  which  expresses  the idea that all humans  possess the  innate  
ability  to learn  and understand  language.  The discussions  in the course  are based  on exampl es from empirical linguistic  
research  and from areas  in which  linguistic  expertise  is relevant  (e.g. law; language  policy  and literacy  planning in South 
Africa; media and translation; speech  therapy).

Prerequisite:  Recommended: Linguistics 1A,1B  
Description: To intr oduce students to key issues relating to multilingualism and multiculturalism in South Africa.  
Content:  Multilingualism  and language  planning  issues  are explored  through  acquainting  students  with aspects  of South 
Africa's linguistic heritage and diversity.  Particular attention is given to phenomena such as language contact (e.g. code -
switching  and mixing,  pidgins  and creoles),  language  spread  (e.g. new dialects  of English)  and language  loss (e.g. the  case 
of Tamil).  Students  will investigate  the sociolingui stic features  of these  phenomena  and carry  out a small -scale empirical

Prerequisite:  Recommended: Linguistics 1A,1B, 2A  
Description: To familiarise students with the cognitive dimensions of linguistics.  
Content: In this course we investigate the nature of the c ognitive processes underlying the production, perception and 
comprehension of natural language. We cover psycholinguistics (the study of these language -processing mechanisms) 
and techniques of formal linguistic analysis, in order to explore the nature of t he mental representations that form the 
basis of speakers’ linguistic competence. (This module is of particular relevance for students in cognitive science.)

Prerequisite:  Linguistics 1A,1B, 2A, 2B, for students wishin g to major in Linguistics.  
Description: To investigate the relation between language use in social contexts, discourse structure and general cognition. 
Content: Students are introduced to classical and current accounts of speech act theory and discourse analysis . We 
study linguistic forms and the rules that determine their distribution and we consider the general principles of 
interpretation which people use when making sense of what they hear and read. On the basis of theoretical findings 
from Linguistics, Philoso phy, Cognitive Psychology, and Computer Science, we investigate how people use discourse 
to promote and contest the value systems and social relations of power with which they are associated.  
Assessment: 2 assignments and 1 small -scale research report (40% ); 1 three -hour examination (60%).  
DP:  Submission of all written work on time.

Description: To develop students' expertise in describing and analysing exa mples from different languages.  
Content: In this course, we use formal syntactic theory as a tool to examine and understand language diversity. In 
comparing the st ructural properties of a number of languages, we observe striking similarities and interesting differences, 
and we discuss these observations in relation to the idea of an innate (and therefore universal) underlying linguistic 
competence. We look at the ru les and principles that determine the architecture of phrases and sentences in human 
language, and we discuss contemporary analyses of a variety of syntactic phenomena.

Description: To do an integrative analysis of conceptual and empirical approaches to positive organisational behaviour and 
outcomes. Theory and research covering such areas as self -determining behaviour patter ns, cognitive behaviour change, 
emotional intelligence, psychological capital, innovation, and workplace change are described, analysed, and applied to

best of their employees. Furthermore, the purpose of this course is to equip students with an in -depth understanding to 
the practice of planning, designing, implementing and evaluation of interventions, that encourages students to draw 
knowledge from all the programme modules which will assist them in creating an intervention that can be implemented 
at an organisational level.  
Content: To answer the call for theory aimed at increasing the understanding of the process of organisational virtue 
through positive psychology, this course will combine a theoretical approach with the application of practical 
implementation and interventions of p ositive psychology principles to relevant case studies taken from a variety of 
sources.  The module  covers  theoretical  foundations  and conceptual  themes  of positive  psychology  in the workplace,  as 
well as the development, implementation, and evaluation of i ntervention strategies. The following content is addressed

Description: To develop reflexive professionals who can p rovide an appropriate service to individuals, communities and to society. 
Collectively students construct and deconstruct social and educational worlds to contribute to  a better,  more  nuanced  
understanding  of learning,  educational  and societal  processes.  An evidence  based  personal, professional and academic 
portfolio is developed to be used throughout their professional career. The multidisciplinary nature of the course lends itse lf 
to embodiment of working within a team consisting of different sectors as p art of the learning  process.  
Content: The module develops the ability of the student to be reflexive and critical by deconstructing their own life stories. 
The past, present as well as future are relevant. Reflexivity forms an important part of our theoret ical base and is used 
to promote critical thinking and transformative learning. The complexity of history and transformation of the South African 
context we live in requires that students are prepared sufficiently to deal with complex layers in understandi ng behaviour 
and behaviour change as well as position themselves ethically. Individual stories as well as the grand narrative of our 
country is juxtaposed and deconstructed. The active and continuous consideration of how things  potentially  differ  from 
the way they may appear  to us is what  leads  to critical  reflection.  This process  is often  only possible  through  dialogue  
which  promotes  respect  for difference,  collaboration  and connectedness.

Prerequisite:  An Honours degree  
Description: Bantu Argument Structure and relational grammar theories as well as lexical functional grammar theories depart 
from the theory of Government and Binding (GB). The argument is that grammatical functions are feature complexes, 
with grammatical changing in some languages (especially Bantu type) induced by morphological rules which alter 
argument structures and effect alte rnative realization of semantic roles. This suggests a sub -theory of lexical mapping 
hence our students have to deal with word -hood and word treatment in IsiZulu.  
Content:  Bantu  Argument  Structure,  relational  grammar  theories  and lexical  functional  grammar  theories.  Wordhood  in  
IsiZulu,  isiZulu  Lexicon  and the related  problems.  This involves  looking  at the dictionaries  to see whether  the categories 
are represented according to recent lexicography  theories.
